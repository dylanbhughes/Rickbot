# Rickbot
Ever wanted to chat with Rick from Rick &amp; Morty?

Well I've decided to go ahead and build this guy so now you can.

To get started, clone down the repository and install all dependencies via the command line:

```bash

git clone http://wwww.github.com/dylanbhughes/Rickbot.git

npm install

```

To add to your slack channel:

1) Go to https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot

2) Add the name Rick.

3) When you click "Add Bot Integration", you are taken to a page where you can add additional details about your bot. Add a picture of Rick as the icon and add a description if you feel like it.

4) Copy the API token that Slack gives you.

5) Put that token in a .env file in the home directory.

5) Run the bot:â€‹ ```npm start```
